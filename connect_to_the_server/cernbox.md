# CERNBox

## Introduction 

[CERNBox](https://cernbox.cern.ch/) corresponds to the [EOS space](lxplus.md#eos-space). You can also think the CERNBox as an online hard drive to store your files. 

### Sharing

Since we may possible download the samples in our EOS space or share the slides with others, we should understand how to share the files in the CERNBox.

To share with others, we normally should key in the full name of who you would like to share. It's because sometimes CERNBox cannot find people with only a part of the name.
