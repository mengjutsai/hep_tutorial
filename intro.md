# NTHU HEP Group

## Introduction

We're working on the experimental high energy physics with the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC. In our group, we've mainly contributed to the **measurement of the Higgs boson via a W-boson pair \(HWW\)**. We've just finished the first Run-2 publication for the HWW with 36 fb^-1 data. We are now focusing on the new publication with the more data collected from 2015 to 2018. Hopefully, we will get the results with full Run-2 datasets by the end of 2020. 

Previously, we were also involved in the **searches of the dark matter** produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two bottom quarks \(Mono-Hbb\). Moreover, we also contributed to the **implementation of High-Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS phase-II upgrade**. The upgrade projects are still ongoing!
