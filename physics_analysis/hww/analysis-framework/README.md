# Frameworks

## Introduction 

As mentioned previously, we have two framework frequently used in the HWW group. 

* [HWWAnalysisCode](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/higgs/hww/HWWAnalysisCode) is the **analysis code** for the HWW subgroup based on the Common Analysis Framework \(CAF\).
* [HWWPhysicsxAODMaker](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/higgs/hww/HWWPhysicsxAODMaker) is the **production code** for the HWW subgroup based on the ASG AthAnalysis release.

### Group Disks
