# Frameworks

## Introduction 

As mentioned previously, We have two framework frequently used in the HWW group. 

* [HWWAnalysisCode](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/higgs/hww/HWWAnalysisCode) is the **analysis code** for the HWW subgroup based on the Common Analysis Framework \(CAF\).
* [HWWPhysicsxAODMaker](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-physics/higgs/hww/HWWPhysicsxAODMaker) is the **production code** for the HWW subgroup based on the ASG AthAnalysis release.

### Group Disks

ATLAS HWW group has a group disk for the PxAOD samples. The samples are stored in the following link.

We have different versions of samples. 

* R20 \(R20.7\) samples are for Run-2 36 /fb publication with 2015+2016 data. In the group disk, we don't store the R20 samples, but we have the samples in the following link.

* R21 samples are updated with new recommendations and will generate the samples with full Run-2 140 /fb \(2015-2018 data\).

We currently used the V18 samples. The samples in V18 are used 2015+2016 data and mc16a simulated samples.
