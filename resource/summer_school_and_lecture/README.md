# Schools and Lectures

## Basic level

#### [The International Summer school on TeV Experimental Physics \(ISTEP\)](https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/7854/other-view?view=standard)

ISTEP is kind of a good start point to begin your journey of the research in the high energy physics \(HEP\). ISTEP annually holds in universities in China. 

* alumnus: 
  * 2015: Po-Shan Shih, Cheng-Hsin Han, Yu-Hsin Chan, Ya-Feng Lo, Meng-Ju Tsai
  * 2018: Yu-Cheng Huang

#### [HASCO Summer School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/704163/)

This provides a basic knowledge about particle physics and experimental HEP. If you're new to HEP, It's good to look over the slides in this summer school. 

## Advanced level

#### [CERN Summer Program](https://home.cern/students-educators/summer-student-programme)

This program aims at both undergraduate and graduate students. The application deadline is around **end of January every year**. CERN summer program cover your living and travel expenses, which is 90 CHF per day covering weekend.

This program provide 6-week [lectures](https://indico.cern.ch/category/345/) covering almost all topics about experimental particle physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Moreover, participants will be **assigned a project** and cooperate with researchers in CERN. More details are described in the [subsection](cern-summer-school.md). 

#### [CERN-Fermilab Summer school](http://hcpss.web.cern.ch/hcpss/)

This is a summer program jointing between CERN and Fermilab. CERN and Fermilab take turns holding the summer schools every year. 

* alumnus: Meng-Ju Tsai \(2018\)

#### [DESY Summer school](https://summerstudents.desy.de/)

There are several nice slides in the summer schools. It seems that this summer school will also provide stipend for summer students. 

* being accepted but not participated: Ya-Feng Lo \(2018\)

#### [IoPAS Summer school](http://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~summer/) \(中研院物理所暑期實習\)

This is a summer program to do research with researchers in institute of physics, Academic Sinica. It will provide $20000 NTD per month \(totally 2 months\). The application deadline is in May every year. 

If you're interested in working on the projects in the ATLAS experiment, you will be recommended to be work with Song-Ming Wang, who've worked on the ATLAS experiment for many years!

* alumnus: Yu-Hsin Chan \(2016\), Meng-Ju Tsai \(2017\) \(Both worked with Song-Ming Wang\)

#### [SLAC Summer school](https://conf.slac.stanford.edu/ssi2018/)

The topics in this summer school change annually. 

* alumnus: Chen-Hsun Chan, Yu-Heng Lin

#### [PISA School on Future Colliders](https://indico.cern.ch/event/669093/overview)

This summer school mainly discuss about the future colliders on the market. 

* alumnus: Meng-Ju Tsai \(2018\)

#### [CTEQ Summer school](https://www.physics.smu.edu/scalise/cteq/schools/summer18/)

* alumnus: Yun-Ju Lu 

#### [CERN-JINR European School of High-Energy Physics](http://physicschool.web.cern.ch/PhysicSchool/ESHEP/ESHEP2018/)

#### [Tri-Institute Summer School on Elementary Particles](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/conference/tri-institute-summer-school-elementary-particles-2018)

#### [Queen Mary Summer School](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/summer-school/)
