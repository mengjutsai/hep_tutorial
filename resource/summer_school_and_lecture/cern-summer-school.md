# CERN Summer School

## Introduction

CERN annually provides a very good summer program with 6-week lectures and a suitable training project. This program aims at undergraduate and graduate students. This program will provide you enough money to fly to CERN, stay at CERN and also travel around Swiss. Therefore, you don't need to worry about the money for living expense.  

The application to this program is somehow competitive, so it will be good to write a clearer introduction for yourself. Here we have some [examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NINmFAcOZOmUf5Klqm9iQmINsWVGbwpa?usp=sharing) for the material required for applications. The examples are from the alumnus from this program! Moreover, you will be required to have two reference letters, therefore, it's important to have some research experiences and get the letter from them.
