# CERN Summer School

## Application

The application to this program is somehow competitive, so you're required to write a clear self introduction and a Curriculum Vitae \(CV\). Moreover, it will really help if you do some \(basic\) undergraduate researches before application. Moreover, since you will be required to send out two reference letters, you should find who your prospective referrers are as soon as possible. Doing undergraduate researches can increase the probability to get the recommendation letters from the professors!

### Application materials

Here we have some [examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NINmFAcOZOmUf5Klqm9iQmINsWVGbwpa?usp=sharing) of the application materials required for applications. The examples are from the alumnus participating this program in 2016, 2018 and 2019.
